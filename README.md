## Deploying to Vercel

This project is ready for static deployment on Vercel. To deploy:

1. Sign in to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and create a new project.
2. Connect your GitHub repository or upload your project folder.
3. Vercel will detect the `index.html` and deploy as a static site.
4. The included `vercel.json` ensures all routes are handled by `index.html`.

No build step is required. All static assets in `css/`, `js/`, and the root will be served automatically.
